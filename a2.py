            area
            - <se> is the longitude and latitude in the southeast corner of this
            area
        and record the dispatch time as <when>.
        Area boundaries are inclusive. For example, the point (4.0, 10.0)
        is considered within the area defined by
                    NW = (1.0, 10.0) and SE = (25.0, 2.0)

                latitude values decrease as we move further south.

        For all clients who have requested rides in this area (i.e., whose
        request has a source location in this area) and a driver has not
        been dispatched to them yet, dispatch drivers to them one at a time,
        from the client with the highest total billings down to the client
        with the lowest total billings, or until there are no more drivers
        available.

        Only drivers who meet all of these conditions are dispatched:
            (a) They are currently on an ongoing shift.
            (b) They are available and are NOT currently dispatched or on
            an ongoing ride.
            (c) Their most recent recorded location is in the area bounded by
            <nw> and <se>.

        When choosing a driver for a particular client, if there are several
        drivers to choose from, choose the one closest to the client's source
        location. In the case of a tie, any one of the tied drivers may be
        dispatched.

        Dispatching a driver is accomplished by adding a row to the Dispatch
        table. The dispatch car location is the driver's most recent recorded
        location. All dispatching that results from a call to this method is
        recorded to have happened at the same time, which is passed through
        parameter <when>.

        If an exception occurs during dispatch, rollback ALL changes.
